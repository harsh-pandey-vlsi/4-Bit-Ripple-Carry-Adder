# 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) on FPGA  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project implements a **4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** using **Verilog HDL** and deploys it on the **Nexys A7 FPGA board** (Artix-7). The design is modeled structurally by connecting four full adders in series, enabling binary addition of two 4-bit numbers with carry propagation.  

The project flow includes:  
1. **Design** â†’ Full Adder â†’ Ripple Carry Adder.  
2. **Simulation** â†’ Testbench-based functional verification in Vivado.  
3. **Implementation** â†’ Synthesis, Implementation, Bitstream Generation.  
4. **Hardware Testing** â†’ Inputs via switches, outputs on LEDs.  

This project demonstrates both **simulation-based validation** and **real-time FPGA testing**.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Results  
- Verified design with multiple input combinations.  
- Example cases:  
  - A = `0101`, B = `0011`, Cin = `0` â†’ Sum = `1000`, Cout = `0`  
  - A = `1111`, B = `0001`, Cin = `0` â†’ Sum = `0000`, Cout = `1`  
- Waveform confirms correct carry propagation across all four full adders.
